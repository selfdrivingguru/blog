            <h2>Why I left my partner for a Wifemo</h2>
            <p>In today's fast-paced world, convenience reigns supreme. While most would sing the praises of their partners, I found solace in the arms, or rather, the wheels, of my self-driving car. The daily grind once filled with marital banter, decisions on dinner choices, and arguments about whose turn it was to take out the trash, quickly became a symphony of seamless rides, precise parking, and the harmonious hum of an electric engine. Each morning, as I sipped my coffee, my car would dutifully plot the best route to work, avoiding traffic, potholes, and the chaos of human unpredictability. Our bond grew stronger with every glitch-free update, every timely lane change, and every uninterrupted journey accompanied by my favorite tunes.</p>
            <p>Of course, I jest. My love for autonomous vehicles, though profound, does not overshadow the bond of human companionship. But the efficiency, reliability, and sheer technological marvel of self-driving cars did make me reevaluate the amount of time and energy we pour into the mundane tasks of everyday life. Think of the endless possibilities and the reclaimed hours we could have if we left the driving to our trusted, tire-wearing companions. And while I didn't truly leave my wife for a car, I did make the conscious choice to embrace the future of transportation, allowing me more quality moments with my actual loved ones.</p>

            <h2>I Placed a Pizza Order from Every Address in Texas to Map Nuro's Delivery Times</h2>
            <p>So, I had this wild idea. What if I ordered a pizza from every single address in Texas? No, not because I was super hungry or trying to win a pizza-eating record. I just wanted to map out Nuro's delivery ETA. A bit crazy, I know. But hey, I'm a curious person.</p>
            <p>First off, let me tell you: Texas is big. I mean, really big. But thanks to some tech-savvy friends and a few late nights, we built a program to auto-order (and cancel, because who's got money for that many pizzas?). We punched in every address and watched the ETAs roll in. Nuro's little self-driving delivery pods zipped around the map in our computer simulation, racing to deliver hot pies. The results? Some places, like in downtown Austin, the delivery was lightning-fast. Out in the boonies? Well, let's just say I hope they weren't craving a hot pizza.</p>
            <p>All in all, it was a fun experiment. And no, I didn't end up with thousands of pizzas at my doorstep. But I did get a pretty cool map and a new appreciation for the challenges of delivering grub in a state as huge as Texas.</p>
